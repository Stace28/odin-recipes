                <li>
                Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry 1¼kg beef mince until browned – you may need to do this in batches.
                Set aside as it browns.</li>
                
            <li>
                Put the other 2 tbsp olive oil into the pan, add 2 finely chopped onions, 3 chopped carrots and 3 chopped celery sticks
                and cook on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 mins.</li>
                
                <li>
                Add 2 finely chopped garlic cloves, 3 tbsp plain flour and 1 tbsp tomato purée, increase the heat and cook for a few
                mins, then return the beef to the pan.</li>
                
                <li>
                Pour over a large glass of red wine, if using, and boil to reduce it slightly before adding the 850ml beef stock, 4 tbsp
                Worcestershire sauce, a few thyme sprigs and 2 bay leaves.</li>
                
                </ol>
