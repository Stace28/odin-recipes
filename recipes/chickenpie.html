    <li>Heat 1 tbsp vegetable oil in a large flameproof casserole or deep frying pan over a high heat. Once hot, brown half the
    chicken pieces on both sides, season and transfer to a plate or bowl. Repeat with the remaining chicken pieces.</li>
    
    <li>
    Reduce the heat to medium and heat the remaining oil in the pan. Fry the onions, celery and carrots for 8-10 mins,
    stirring occasionally and scraping any browned bits from the base, until all the veg has softened. Tip into the bowl
    with the chicken and return the pan to a medium heat.</li>
    
    <li>
    Melt the butter in the pan and stir in the flour to make a paste. Cook for a couple of minutes, stirring until the paste
    turns golden. Add a splash of the milk, then whisk to combine. Continue slowly adding the milk, whisking continuously
    until you have a smooth, creamy sauce.</li>
